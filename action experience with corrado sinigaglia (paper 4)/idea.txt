Broadly, our proposal will be that the influence of motor representations on judgement is like that of visual representations.  Some some visual representations have content-respecting influences on judgement because they give rise to visual experiences of the objects and features represented. Similarly, some motor representations have content-respecting influences on judgement because they give rise to motor experiences of actions.  Or so we shall argue.
