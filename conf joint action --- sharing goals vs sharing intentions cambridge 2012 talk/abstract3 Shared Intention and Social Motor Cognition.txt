Shared Intention and Social Aspects of Motor Representation

Are there distinctive roles for shared intention and social motor representation in explaining the purposiveness of joint action?  This question needs some background.  A joint action is a purposive action, or something resembling one, comprising two or more agents' actions.  What is the relation between a joint action and the outcome (or outcomes) to which it is directed?  Standard answers to this question appeal to a notion of shared intention and ignore social motor representation.  It is tempting (for some philosophers, at least) to suppose that social motor representations are only enabling conditions for joint action, or else to suppose that social motor representation is merely a variety of shared intention.  The talk will provide reasons for rejecting both suppositions.  The truth may be that shared intention and social motor representation have distinctive roles in explaining the purposiveness of joint action.  This gives rise to a challenge.  On one hand, effective joint action---imagine erecting a tent in a gale together---sometimes requires both shared intentions and social motor representations plus a certain kind of harmony between the two.  On the other hand, recognizing their distinctive roles precludes the existence of direct inferential links between shared intentions and social motor representations.  The challenge is to explain how these two kinds of representation could sometimes harmoniously contribute to effective joint action despite the lack of inferential integration.

The first aim of this talk is to outline grounds for a positive answer.  The second aim is to explain why a positive answer leads to a challenge about how shared intentions could non-accidentally be in harmony with social motor representations.
