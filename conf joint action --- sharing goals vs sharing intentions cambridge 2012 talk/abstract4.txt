Intention and Motor Representation in Joint Action

On the assumption that social motor cognition plays a role in explaining how effective joint action is possible, do we also need motor cognition to explain what joint action is?  Philosophers tend to assume that motor cognition is only an enabling condition for joint action and of no direct interest to narrowly philosophical theories of joint action and shared intention.  In this talk I will argue that social motor representation and shared intention  have distinctive roles in explaining the purposiveness of joint action.  This gives rise to a challenge.  On the one hand, effective joint action---imagine two people erecting a tent in a gale together---sometimes requires both shared intentions and social motor representations plus a certain kind of harmony between the two.  On the other hand, recognizing their distinctive roles precludes the existence of direct inferential links between shared intentions and social motor representations.  The challenge is to explain how these two kinds of representation could sometimes harmoniously contribute to effective joint action despite the lack of inferential integration.



***This will make understanding shared intention easier too.

Philosophical accounts of joint action typically involve appeal to exotic ingredients like shared intention, ingredients which are exotic in the sense that they are not needed for characterising ordinary, individual action.  In this talk I suggest that
