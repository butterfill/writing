"Representations for Joint Action"

Abstract

Philosophical questions concerning the roles of intention, motivation, reason and emotion in joint action are closely related to questions about which psychological mechanisms make effective joint action possible.
Recent behavioural and neuroscientific studies have investigated the possibility that agents can integrate a co-actor into their own action planning.
These studies also indicate that individuals plan joint actions from a group perspective rather than an individual perspective.
Whereas philosophers investigating joint action have tended to focus on shared intentions and interlocking commitments, these studies reveal the need for interdependent motor processes and representations.
There is thus a gap between the dominant philosophical approach and the experimental investigation of joint action phenomena. 
As a step towards bridging the gap, this symposium aims to introduce psychological research on how representations of tasks, actions and the consequences of actions facilitate joint action; and to identify associated conceptual challenges.
